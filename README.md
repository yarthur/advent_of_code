# Advent of Code _(advent_of_code)_

> My solutions for the 2017 Advent of Code excercises.

Each day is split into its own directory, with a default script of `index.js`.

## Install

I'm solving with JavaScript, utilizing ES6 modules in Node (without using any Node-specific methods). These scripts are currently running great in Node v8.9.1.

Clone the scripts:
```
git clone https://github.com/yarthur/advent_of_code.git
```

## Usage

Run the scripts (day 1 example is given):
```
node 01/index.mjs
```
